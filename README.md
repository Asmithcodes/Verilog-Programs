# 🧾 Verilog Code Practice (Vivado)

Welcome to my Verilog practice repository!  
This space is dedicated to building, testing, and improving digital logic designs using **Verilog HDL** in **Xilinx Vivado**.

Each project in this repository includes:

- ✅ Main Verilog design file  
- 🧪 Testbench for functional simulation  
- 📷 RTL schematic generated by Vivado  
- ⏱️ Timing diagram from simulation results  

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Vivado Design Suite** – for writing, simulating, and visualizing RTL designs  
- **GTKWave** *(optional)* – for waveform inspection (if exported as VCD)  
- **Git & GitHub** – for version control and progress tracking  

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each subfolder represents a self-contained Verilog project:

<pre lang="md"> ``` Verilog-Programs/ ├── 1x8_Demux/ │ ├── 1x8_demux.v │ ├── 1x8_demux_Tb.v │ └── images/ │ ├── schematic.png │ └── timing_diagram.png ├── 8x1_Mux/ │ ├── 8x1_mux.v │ ├── 8x1_mux_Tb.v │ └── images/ │ ├── schematic.png │ └── timing_diagram.png └── ... ``` </pre>

## 📂 What’s Included in Each Project

- `*.v` → Main Verilog design file  
- `*_Tb.v` → Testbench module  
- `Test_bench.png` → RTL schematic (Vivado-generated)  
- `Timing_diagram.png` → Simulation waveform

## 🚀 How to Simulate in Vivado

1. Create a new project in Vivado.
2. Add both the design and testbench `.v` files.
3. Set the testbench as the **top module**.
4. Run simulation to view waveform and RTL schematic.
5. Export timing diagrams and schematics as `.png` files (for documentation or GitHub).

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm **Asmith Pampana**, a B.Tech student in **Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)** at  
**Vidya Jyothi Institute of Technology**.

I'm passionate about digital electronics, circuit design, and low-level hardware programming using Verilog.  
This repository is part of my journey toward mastering HDL design and building a strong digital logic foundation.

## 📌 Notes

All projects are built and tested entirely in **Vivado**, so waveform and schematic visuals follow Vivado's representation.  
Feel free to fork, clone, or contribute — especially if you're also learning Verilog or preparing for digital design interviews or labs.
